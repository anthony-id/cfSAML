Originally written in 2009, this is a rough draft version for public consumption of a 
ColdFusion helper object to write SAML.

It's purpose is to compose the SAML to post to a service provider for SSO integration. 

It is not a replacement for something like Shibboleth by a long stretch, but has handled
my Identity Provider needs very well to this point. I needed to add SAML 1.0 at a later 
point so it was refactored to add that capability.

There is one jar depenendency - xmlsec, the Apache XML Security library.    

Additional configuration and refactoring is needed before this is fully releasable code. 
It is, however, 99% complete and could be used with a little work.
